# GithubPractice
For the "Github Practice w/ a Partner" assignment

Q1: Represents the history of the one branch you pulled all the way up to the origin (tree trunk).

Q2: Makes the version that is being pushed into git the NEW DEFAULT that then people can download from the same git origin. Remote tracking in this contexts tracks the newest most updated form of the git status and, assuming somebody pulls from it, will get that newest edition from the origin.

Q3: git pull origin master take commits from the master (main) branch and combines it with the branch that is currently being edited in the local repository.

Q4: No... that would be like... really stupid... right? That would... like.... delete all your progress and make everything messy...?

Q5: Merge! Two 'histories' are combined into one, not rerouted.

Q6: Brandon's (person B) branch is ahead of the current main. It still needs to be syched up.

Q7: Yes, Brandon's copy of "AwesomeBranch" did get deleted when Roan deleted the branch from github

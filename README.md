# GithubPractice
For the "Github Practice w/ a Partner" assignment

Q1: Represents the history of the one branch you pulled all the way up to the origin (tree trunk).

Q2: Makes the version that is being pushed into git the NEW DEFAULT that then people can download from the same git origin. Remote tracking in this contexts tracks the newest most updated form of the git status and, assuming somebody pulls from it, will get that newest edition from the origin.
